# IBM_DataScienceCapstone

Hello World!
This is the repository from my First project as a Data Scient learner.
The IBM data science Capstone is about SpaceX Falcon 9 Launches, in this project we create a model to
predict if a Falcon 9 Launch will be successful or not. 

The process that were made in this project are:
1 - Data Collection with Web Scrapping using Beautiful Soup
2 - Data Collection with SpaceX API
3 - Data Wrangling
4 - Exploratory Data Analysis with Visualization
5 - Exploratory Data Analysis with sql using the storage service db2 from IBM
6 - Visual analysis with Folium
7 - Machine Learning prediction with different models

Regards!
